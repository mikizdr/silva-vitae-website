# How to use pnpm in this project

- Use `pnpm install` to install dependencies.
- Use `pnpm run <script>` to run scripts (e.g., `pnpm run lint`).
- You can remove `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` if you want to fully switch to pnpm.
- pnpm will use `pnpm-lock.yaml` for dependency locking.
